A collection of minigames from the Mastery School of Hawken!
Created by students in the 2024 Spring Master Class "Game Dev With Unity"

The class was taught by me, Jonah, over the course of a week.  I also meshed everything together into this repo, but the games themselves were made by individual students with no prior Unity experience, they're awesome.
